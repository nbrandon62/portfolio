# Welcome to my Personal Portfolio!
Hey there! My name is Brandon Nguyen, and I'm excited to welcome you to my personal portfolio. This is where I showcase my projects, skills, and experiences thus far. This is a quick glimpse of the work I've done in and outside of work.

## About Me
I'm a front end developer passionate about cooking and food. My favorite project that I'm always iterating and building upon is the cheflife at home app. I hope it will one day consistently answer the question "what am I going to cook this week?" for myself and for others! I'm also always thinking of better ways to communicate, listen, and foster a safe space for others in my personal and work life. 

## What You'll Find Here
In my portfolio, you'll find a variety of projects that demonstrate my skills and experience. Feel free to browse around and check out my work. If you're interested in learning more, I've also included links to my blog posts and social media accounts.
